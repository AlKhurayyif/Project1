# Project1
:: Project ::
I use data of weather data for the city of Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, covering the period from 2008 to 2017 to answer three Questions.

:: Questions ::
Q1: How to find the hight of station with standerd error ..?
Q2: Can you see if temperature and humidity have changed or not along 11 years ..?
Q3: Is there correlation between temperature and humidity ..?


:: Dastaset ::
I git Data from Kaggle in this link:

:: Libraries used ::
pandas 
numpy
plotly.express 
seaborn 

:: Motivation for the project ::
Mecca is one of the most important cities in the world, as millions of Muslims from around the globe converge on it five times a day. Due to the availability of weather-related data for the period from 2008 to 2017 .

:: The files in the repository with a small description of each ::
Dataset: It contains all the data.
Pics: It contains all the picture.
Tempreture.ipytb: the fike of code.

:: Summary of the results ::
It can be said that although the study is modest, we found out that utilizing the data of average pressure and average temperature and employing the barometric relationship we can determine the elevation of the monitoring station, Also, it was found that the variation is not significant between the average temperature and average humidity for each month during the study period. Finally, we found that the correlation is weak and cannot be relied upon. This means that there is no strong or significant relationship between the average temperature and average humidity.

:: Acknowledgments ::
I want to acknowledge the user saudiarabiaweather in kaggle for providing the data.
